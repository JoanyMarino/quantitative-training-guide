# Hypothesis, predictions and equations {#hypothesis}

(**AH: Sorry Joany, I meant this one: https://github.com/ahurford/quantitative-training-2/blob/master/first%20year/Biology%201001%20-%20Lab%20Manual%20-%20Fall%202019%20v0.4.docx in .docx with tracked changes: however, not all the track changes are accepted. You'll have to make a personal copy, accept the changes, cut and paste then just do a bit with the formatting, symbols and boxes**)

(**Up to here is the content of "Appendix II - The Scientific Method".**
**Should we continue with "Appendix III - Writing up Experiments"?**)

(** AH: Just the part that is Hypothesis, predictions and equations**)
