# Data and metadata

I think look at the Ethan White course. The paper by Kara Woo is quite good and worth a cite.

Here we need to provide the rationale for saving data as we recommend we also need to provide the metadata guidelines. Maybe find a paper by someone who is up on this kind of stuff and see how they did the metadata. Also talk about why highlight cells in excel or making borders isn't a good idea, i.e. tidy data exercise.
