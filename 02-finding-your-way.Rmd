# Finding your way around RStudio {#rstudio}

R studio has 4 windows (also known as "panes") that are inter-linked. The default layout is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:panes). You can move the layout of the panes and change their size and shape by clicking and dragging with your mouse along the window pane borders. The details of what happens in each pane are detailed below.

```{r panes, fig.cap="Panes in RStudio.", fig.align='center', out.width="70%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figures/Fig_5_1.jpg')
```

## Console pane

The Console pane is labelled 1 in Figure X. The Console pane has a prompt (the `>` symbol) and here the code is evaluated (also referred to as executed).

TRY IT! type 5 + 5 in the console at the prompt and press "enter". You'll see the R gives the correct output (10).

```{r}
5+5
```

Use the console to test and query code, or do a quick analysis that you do not want to save. Press the up arrow to scroll through past commands, from most to least recent.

You can overwrite variables. The current value of your variable is the last value you gave it. In the console type:

```{r}
x = 2
```
Press `enter/return`

```{r}
x = 1
```

Press `enter/return`. What is the value of

```{r}
x + 1
```

Type:

```{r}
x
```

to query the current value of `x`.

EXCERCISE

Can you write the code, and execute the commands in the correct order so that `x + 1 = 6`?

----

## Source pane

The Source pane is labelled Y in Figure X. The Source pane is where you create, save, and edit `R` scripts. `R` scripts are blocks of code that perform a task that you want to save (i.e., are the answer to the EXERCISE above, or import and clean data to make a figure) and when saved have a `.R` extension. When you've written and saved a script, you can re-use it for future projects. 
Try it now: open and save a new `.R` file to save your work in. In the top menu select `File > New File > R Script`, then `File > Save As`. Paste the following `R` code into your script and save it:

```
x = 4
x = 6
```

Now, you have saved this code, but has it been evaluated? To answer this question type `x` in your `Console` and press ENTER:

```{r}
x
```

It is important to note that saving commands in a script in your `Source` window does not evaluate the commands in your `Console`. To execute the commands, with your script displayed in the `Source` pane, you need to click the `Source` button (righthand side of the source pane, equivalently select `Code > Source` from the top menu bar; note, if you have a small `Source` pane the `Source` button may not appear and you may need to make it bigger or use the menu bar).

`Source` your script and then evalate `x` in your `Console`. If you have done this task correctly the value of `x` should be `6` and it will appear as `[1] 6` in your `Console`.

What happened to `x = 2`? When `Source` is called the commands are executed in the `Console` from top to bottom as they appear in the script. Therefore, `x = 2` was only the current value of `x` for a very short time before it was overwritten with the command `x = 6`. 

---

EXERCISE

Edit your script so that now it reads:

```
x = 4
y = x + 1
x = 6
z = x + 1
```

`Source` the script and then query the values of `y` and `z` in your `Console`.

```
> y
> z
```

Explain why the values of `y` and `z` are `5` and `7` respectively.

---

... AH: This is where I stopped editing

If you would like to run one line or several lines of your script only (not all the lines), then place your cursor on the line you want to execute and click the `Run` button (equivalenty `Code > Run Selected Line(s)`).



## Enviornment/History pane

This pane has several tabs, we'll discuss each in turn.

### Environment tab {-}

This shows you the names of all data objects (e.g., vectors, matrices, dataframes) that you've defined in the current R session, along with information about the size of data objects. 

There are also clickable actions, like "Import data set", which we'll refer to later.

### History tab {-}

This shows you a history of all the code you've previously run in the console. 

## File/Plots/Packages/Help pane

This pane also has a few tabs

### Files tab {-}

This tab gives you access to the file directory on your own computer. It's a useful spot to set your working directory (see Chapter \@ref(data-entry)).

### Plots tab {-}

This tab lets you see all the plots (graphs) that you create. You can also uset the buttons at the top to zoom, and to export the graph as a PDF or jpeg file.

Mention the back arrow if mutiple plots are made.

### Packages tab {-}

This tab shows a list of all the R packages installed on your computer (see chapter 5 for more on installing packages). It also indicates which are loaded with a check mark.

Packages are add-on functions and datasets that you can add to your `R` installation. To install a package...

### Help tab {-}

This lets you get help with R functions. Type the name of the function in the search window (blank bar with the magnifying glass beside it). See Chapter \@ref(help) "Getting R help" for more details.
