# First Quantitative Lab in BIOL 1001 (before potato lab)

## Purpose
-	To familiarize students with R Studio
-	To get students working with data input and simple data visualizations
-	To have students think about how different data visualizations convey different information

## Activities

1.	Intro/tour of RStudio (30 minutes)
2.	Data entry and reproducing a graph
3.	Create a different kind of graph of the same data

## Questions

1.	In the bar graph, what can you tell about the stomatal openings of the treatment plant vs. the control plants? Is it consistent across all the individual plants?
2.	Label the following on the box plot (mean, 25% and 75% quantiles, 95% confidence limits, outliers).
3.	What does the box plot tell you about the differences between the treatment plants (plants 6-11) vs. the control plants that the treatment plant does not?
4.	Why do you think a scientist might choose to represent these data one way over another?
