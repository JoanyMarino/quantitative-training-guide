# Introduction

Amy will write this section

Quantitative skills are important in biology. Quantitative skills include performing statistical analyses, using computer software to manage and reformat data, design experiments, understand graphs, vizualizing data, identify genes from DNA sequences, construct 3D models of protiens, and make phylogenies. Many of these tasks are now performed using computers, and elements of computer programming, statistics, and applied mathematics can be useful for professional biologists. Quantitative skills are being incorporated throughout the biology major.

- Why is this important
- Why have we made the choices we did (R, pedagogy citations)
Biologists use a variety of tools and in recent years, the use of computers has become widespread. Many different softwares are used by biologists including Microsoft Office, R, Python, and ArcGIS. First year biology, will introduce you to using R to visualize data, although we note that many of the same end results could be generated using different software. Our choice of R is for the following reasons:

1. R programming is a valued skill: citation.

1. Reproducibility:

1. Accessibility: `R` is free.

1. No limits: while it is possible to need data visualization options or statistical analysis that are unavailable in `Microsoft Excel` this is rarely a problem in `R`: there is an `R` package for anything, from [serious](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/10/09/population-modeling-in-r/) to [fun](https://www.r-bloggers.com/useless-but-fun-r-packages/)).
